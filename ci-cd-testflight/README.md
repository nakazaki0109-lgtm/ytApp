# CI/CD TestFlight Project

This project demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for a Swift application using GitHub Actions and Fastlane to automate the process of building and deploying the app to TestFlight.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ci-cd-testflight
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
   - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
   - [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/)
   - [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

3. **Configure Fastlane**
   Update the `fastlane/Appfile` with your app's identifier and Apple developer account information.

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. It will automatically trigger on pushes to the repository, running tests and deploying to TestFlight.

5. **Running Fastlane Locally**
   You can run Fastlane lanes locally to build and upload your app:
   ```bash
   fastlane <lane_name>
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Make sure to commit your changes and push to the repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for the status of your builds and deployments.
- Refer to the Fastlane documentation for more details on customizing your lanes and actions.
