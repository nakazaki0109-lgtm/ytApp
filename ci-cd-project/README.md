# CI/CD Project for iOS Application

This project sets up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environment for an iOS application. The workflow is designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the app to TestFlight whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ci-cd-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, including Xcode and Fastlane. You can install Fastlane using:
   ```bash
   gem install fastlane
   ```

3. **Configure Fastlane**
   Update the `fastlane/Appfile` with your app's identifier and Apple developer account details.

4. **CI/CD Workflow**
   The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`. This file specifies the steps to build the app, run tests, and deploy to TestFlight.

5. **Running Fastlane**
   You can manually trigger Fastlane lanes using:
   ```bash
   fastlane <lane_name>
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Push changes to the main branch to trigger the CI/CD workflow.
- Monitor the GitHub Actions tab for build and deployment status.
- Ensure that all tests pass before merging changes to the main branch.
